i know that we pull image from dockerhub for ci cd project , containerize app, and we deploy app to kubernetes and finally push image to dockerhub, here which one happens first?
push image to dockerhub or deploy app to kubernetes . tel me complete cycle between image push pull and kubernetes?

The complete cycle of pushing and pulling a Docker image for a CI/CD project and deploying the app to Kubernetes typically follows a specific sequence of steps. Here's the breakdown of the full cycle:

1. Code Changes & Git Push
Developer writes code for the application and pushes the changes to a version control system like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
2. CI Pipeline Triggered
A Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (e.g., using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) is triggered automatically when changes are detected in the repository.
3. Build Docker Image
The CI pipeline builds the Docker image for the application.
Dockerfile is used to create the container image, packaging the application code and its dependencies.
4. Run Tests
Tests (unit tests, integration tests, static code analysis) are executed within the Docker container to validate the code.
5. Push Image to DockerHub (or other registry)
Once the image passes all tests, the CI pipeline pushes the Docker image to a container registry, such as DockerHub, AWS ECR, or Google Container Registry.
Example:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t your-app-image .
docker tag your-app-image dockerhub-username/your-app-image:version
docker push dockerhub-username/your-app-image:version
6. Trigger Deployment to Kubernetes
After the image is successfully pushed to DockerHub (or any registry), the Continuous Deployment (CD) process kicks in.
A Kubernetes manifest (YAML files) is used to define how to deploy the application (e.g., Deployment, Service, Ingress).
The Kubernetes YAML references the new image from DockerHub, pulling it down during deployment.
Kubernetes runs the image in the pods within the cluster.
Example Deployment YAML:
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-app-container
        image: dockerhub-username/your-app-image:version  # Image from DockerHub
7. Kubernetes Pulls Image & Deploys
Kubernetes pulls the image from DockerHub or your registry.
The image is deployed to the Kubernetes cluster, where pods are created based on the pulled image.
Kubernetes manages the application scaling, self-healing, and load balancing as per the configuration.
8. Verify Deployment & Monitoring
After deployment, health checks or status checks ensure that the application is running smoothly.
Monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana, or logging tools like ELK stack, can be used to observe the performance of the application.
Summary of Order:
Pull image from DockerHub to build and test in the CI pipeline.
Push image to DockerHub after tests pass.
Deploy app to Kubernetes, which then pulls the image from DockerHub.
The image is pushed to DockerHub first, and then Kubernetes pulls the image to deploy it.

# Docker-Project
Real-Time Project that involves containerizing a microservice application and integrating Docker into a CI/CD pipeline. Below is a step-by-step guide for setting up such a project.

Project Title: "Dockerized Microservice Application with CI/CD Pipeline"
Overview
You will build a simple microservice application, containerize it using Docker, push the Docker image to a container registry (Docker Hub or AWS ECR), and set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

Technologies Involved:
Docker: Containerization platform
GitHub: Version control and source code repository
Jenkins/GitHub Actions: CI/CD tool
Docker Hub or AWS ECR: Container image registry
Kubernetes or AWS ECS: Deployment platform (optional)
Slack: Notification (optional)
Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Build a Simple Microservice Application
You will create a simple Python Flask web app (or Node.js, Go, etc., based on your preference). Here's an example using Flask.

Project Structure:

Copy code
docker-microservice/
├── app/
│   ├── app.py
│   └── requirements.txt
└── Dockerfile

--------------app.py (Flask app):-----------------------
--------------req.txt------------------
----------------Dockerfile------------------(to cont app)
Build image and run ur container locally
- docker build -t docker-microservice .
- docker run -p 5000:5000 docker-microservice
Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser to see the app in action.

Push Docker Image to a Registry
Once the Docker image is ready, push it to a container registry like Docker Hub or AWS ECR.

Push to Docker Hub:
docker login
docker tag docker-microservice asgeorge123/docker-microservice:latest
docker push asgeorge123/docker-microservice:latest

Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline
Next, automate the build and deployment process using Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

Option 1: GitHub Actions Pipeline
Create a .github/workflows/docker-ci-cd.yml file to automate the Docker build and push process.
----------------docker-ci-cd.yml-------------------
Make sure to add DOCKER_USERNAME, DOCKER_PASSWORD, and SLACK_TOKEN to GitHub Secrets.

Deploy Docker Containers
Once your image is built and pushed, you can deploy it using Kubernetes (AKS, GKE, EKS) or AWS ECS.

--------------------Example deployment on Kubernetes:-----------------------------

Add Notifications
Integrate Slack or another messaging tool for build status notifications as shown in the GitHub Actions pipeline.

8. Monitor and Scale
Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for metrics and logs and configure auto-scaling for containers if deploying in Kubernetes or ECS.

Bonus: Add Auto-scaling with Kubernetes
You can add Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes to auto-scale your application based on CPU or memory usage:

Summary of the Project
Containerized Microservice: Flask app using Docker.
Docker Hub/ECR Push: Automated with CI/CD.
CI/CD Pipeline: Built using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
Deployment: Optional deployment to Kubernetes or ECS.
Monitoring and Scaling: Integrated tools like Prometheus and HPA.
This project covers Docker, CI/CD, and container deployment, providing a solid foundation for roles like DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer, or SRE.
